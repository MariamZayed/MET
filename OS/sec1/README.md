# Chapter 1 – Operating System

## 1. Introduction

An **Operating System (OS)** is the most important <mark>software</mark> in any computer system. It works as an **intermediary** between the user and the hardware.

* Without an OS → hardware is useless for the user.
* With an OS → the user can interact easily with the system.

**Examples:** Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS.

## 2. What Operating Systems Do

Operating systems have **two views**:

* **User View:**

  * Provides an easy interface (GUI, applications).
  * Makes the system usable.

* **System View:**

  * Manages hardware resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices).
  * Ensures efficiency and security.

## 3. What is the Kernel?

The **Kernel** is the core of the OS. It is responsible for:

* Process management (running programs).
* Memory management.
* Device management (I/O).

**Analogy:** Kernel = School Principal (not always visible, but manages everything).

## 4. Computer System Components

A computer system is divided into **5 parts**:

1. **Hardware** – CPU, memory, I/O devices.
2. **Operating System** – controls and manages resources.
3. **System Programs** – compilers, loaders, basic utilities.
4. **Application Programs** – browsers, games, Word, etc.
5. **Users** – people interacting with the system.
