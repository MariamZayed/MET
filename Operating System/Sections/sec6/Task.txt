✅ Part 1: Understanding the Code (Warm-up)

1. In this code, what is the purpose of each array:

at[]

bt[]

st[]

ft[]

wt[]

tat[]



2. What does st[i] represent?
When is it calculated?


3. Explain the meaning of this formula:

tat[i] = ft[i] - at[i];


4. Why do we calculate Waiting Time as:

wt[i] = tat[i] - bt[i];


5. What will happen if we remove the line that updates ft[i]?

✅ Part 2: Tracing FCFS (Manual Dry Run)

Given the following input:

Number of processes = 3
P1: AT = 0 , BT = 5
P2: AT = 2 , BT = 3
P3: AT = 4 , BT = 1

6. Fill the following table step by step:



Process AT BT ST FT WT TAT



7. At what time does the CPU become idle (if any)?


8. What line in the code handles the case when the CPU is idle?

✅ Part 3: FCFS Logic Questions

9. Why does FCFS not depend on Burst Time for scheduling?


10. If two processes arrive at the same time, how does the code decide which one executes first?


11. Is this implementation of FCFS preemptive or non-preemptive?
Why?




---

✅ Part 4: Transition Thinking (FCFS → SJF non-preemptive)

Using the same input as before:

12. If we change the scheduling to non-preemptive SJF, which process executes first? Why?


13. Compare the execution order between:



FCFS

non-preemptive SJF


14. Which algorithm gives smaller average waiting time for this input?
Justify your answer without coding.




---

✅ Part 5: Reading the SJF Code Carefully

Look at this part of the SJF code:

if (!completed[i] && at[i] <= time && bt[i] < minBT)

15. Explain the role of each condition separately.


16. What will happen if we remove:



at[i] <= time

17. What is the role of the completed[] array?
Why can't we rely on bt[] alone?




---

✅ Part 6: Deep Understanding (Critical Thinking)

18. Why is sorting by Arrival Time not mandatory in SJF non-preemptive?


19. In non-preemptive SJF, when exactly do we choose the next process?



Every time unit?

Or only when the CPU becomes free?


20. Explain why non-preemptive SJF can cause starvation.




---

✅ Part 7: Predict Without Running

Given:

P1: AT=0, BT=8
P2: AT=1, BT=4
P3: AT=2, BT=2
P4: AT=3, BT=1

21. Write the execution order for:



FCFS

non-preemptive SJF


22. Which process waits the longest in FCFS?
Which one waits the longest in SJF?




---

✅ Part 8: Code Awareness (No New Code)

23. If we remove the array st[], can we still calculate WT and TAT?
Explain.


24. Which variables are essential for FCFS scheduling logic?
Which ones are only for output?


25. Write one sentence describing the main idea of:



FCFS

non-preemptive SJF
