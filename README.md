##  About

This repository includes teaching materials, session examples, and code samples from the courses Iâ€™ve taught as a **Teaching Assistant at MET**.  
It reflects a dual teaching approach â€” combining **theoretical understanding** with **hands-on practice**, where each session includes:
- A short task (assignment) for each weekly session.
- One or two **in-session quizzes** each semester to reinforce understanding.

## Teaching Approach

I believe that deep understanding comes when students know **why** before **how**.  
My sessions are designed to:
- Simplify core computer science concepts.  
- Encourage logical reasoning and visualization.  
- Build consistent progress through weekly tasks and assessments.  
- Support students individually when needed beyond the classroom.
